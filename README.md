# PySpark-Driven-Banking-Data-Processing-and-Analysis
This project leverages PySpark to design and implement a scalable banking data processing and analysis framework. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights from large banking datasets, enabling informed decision-making and optimizing banking operations.

**Introduction**

In this project, we utilize **PySpark**, a powerful Python library for big data processing, to analyze a real-world banking dataset. The objective is to extract insights into customer behavior by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data. Through various stages, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building, we aim to demonstrate how PySpark can be applied to address real-world challenges in the banking industry.

**Data**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a bank and contains critical information such as:

*Customer demographics
*Account balances
*Transaction history

The data is stored in a CSV file, which will be loaded into a PySpark DataFrame for comprehensive analysis.

**Data Cleaning**
The initial phase involves cleaning the data to ensure its quality. This includes:

*Handling missing values
*Removing duplicate records
*Casting data types to appropriate formats

We leverage PySpark’s built-in functions such as dropna(), dropDuplicates(), and cast() for effective data cleaning.

**Feature Engineering**
Once the data is cleaned, we create new features that enhance our analysis. These features include:

*Average account balance
*Number of transactions
*Customer age

These new attributes will provide deeper insights into customer behavior.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
After cleaning and feature engineering, we conduct EDA to better understand the dataset. Key operations include:

*Statistical summaries using describe()
*Grouping data by churn status with groupBy()
*Visualizing the average account balance

We will utilize PySpark’s visualization capabilities, combined with libraries like Matplotlib, for meaningful data representation.

**Model Building**
The final step involves building a predictive model to forecast customer churn. We will:

*Train and evaluate various models using PySpark’s machine learning library (ml)
*Employ techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to optimize model parameters

**Sample Code Implementation**
python

# Import necessary libraries
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator
from pyspark.ml.tuning import ParamGridBuilder, CrossValidator

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("BankingProject").getOrCreate()

# Load the data into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.csv("path/to/data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Data cleaning
df = df.dropna()
df = df.dropDuplicates()
df = df.withColumn("age", col("age").cast("integer"))

# Feature engineering
df = df.withColumn("avg_balance", (col("balance") / col("transactions")))
df = df.withColumn("customer_age", (col("year") - col("birth_year")))

# Exploratory Data Analysis
df.describe().show()
df.groupBy("churn").count().show()
df.select("avg_balance").show()

# Prepare data for model building
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["avg_balance", "customer_age"], outputCol="features")
data = assembler.transform(df)

# Split data into training and test sets
train, test = data.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3])

# Build the model
lr = LogisticRegression(labelCol="churn")

# Set up the parameter grid for cross-validation
paramGrid = ParamGridBuilder() \
    .addGrid(lr.regParam, [0.1, 0.01]) \
    .addGrid(lr.elasticNetParam, [0.5, 0.8]) \
    .build()

# Set up the evaluator
evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="churn")

# Set up the cross-validator
cv = CrossValidator(estimator=lr, estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid, evaluator=evaluator)

# Train the model
model = cv.fit(train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.transform(test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy: ", evaluator.evaluate(predictions))

**Conclusion**

This project showcases how PySpark can be effectively utilized to analyze banking transactions and predict customer churn. By leveraging PySpark’s robust data processing and machine learning capabilities, we have successfully cleaned and prepared the data, performed exploratory data analysis, and developed a predictive model.

This analysis not only highlights the potential of PySpark in the banking sector but also serves as a valuable reference for those looking to extract insights from large datasets in similar contexts.
